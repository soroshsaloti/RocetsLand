# Rocets Landing
You need to design a library that will help determine if rockets can land on a platform. 
Whenever rocket is getting back from the orbit, it needs to check every now and then if it's on 
a correct trajectory to safely land on a platform. Whole landing area (area that contains 
landing platform and surroundings) consists of multiple squares that set a 
perimeter/dimensions that can be described with coordinates (say x and y). Assuming that 
landing area has size of square 100x100 and landing platform has a size of a square 10x10 
and it's top left corner starts at a position 5,5 (please assume that position 0,0 is located at 
the top left corner of landing area and all positions are relative to it), library should work as 
follows: 
- if rocket asks for position **5,5** it replies **`ok for landing`**
- if rocket asks for position **16,15**, it replies **`out of platform`**
- if the rocket asks for a position that has previously been checked by another rocket
(only last check counts), it replies with **`clash`**
- if the rocket asks for a position that is located next to a position that has previously
been checked by another rocket **(say, previous rocket asked for position 7,7 and the
rocket asks for 7,8 or 6,7 or 6,6)**, it replies with `clash`.Given the above.
- Please create a library (just library, it doesn't need to be used on any cli/gui) that will support 
following features:
1. rocket can query it to see if it's on a good trajectory to land at any moment
2. library can return one of the following values: **'out of platform', 'clash', 'ok for landing'**
3. more than one rocket can land on the same platform at the same time and rockets
need to have at least one unit separation between their landing positions
4. platform size can vary and should be configurable
